### DEVELOPER NOTES

## topics to learn to implement knowledge graph
- Graph Theory
    - Directed Acyclic Graphs [X] and cycle detection [X]
        - 6/25/2025: researched and learned cycle detection algorithm
    - topological sorting 
    - Graph traversal (DFS/BFS for finding learning paths) [X]
    - Reachability analysis (what topics become available after mastering others)

- Database Design for Graph Structures
    - Adjacency list representation in SQL
    - Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for path finding
    - Graph database vs relational database trade-offs
    - Indexing strategies for graph queries
-  Knowledge Graph Construction Algorithms (Why necessary: You need algorithms to automatically detect implicit prerequisites (like "Merge K Lists" requiring "Merge 2 Lists" + "Heaps") rather than manually defining every relationship.
Key concepts:)
    - Concept similarity detection using embeddings
    - Dependency inference rules and heuristics
    - Topic complexity scoring algorithms
    - Automated prerequisite discovery
